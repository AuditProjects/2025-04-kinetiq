- Starts April 7, 2025 20:00 UTC
- Ends April 16, 2025 20:00 UTC

**Note re: risk level upgrades/downgrades**

Two important notes about judging phase risk adjustments: 
- High- or Medium-risk submissions downgraded to Low-risk (QA) will be ineligible for awards.
- Upgrading a Low-risk finding from a QA report to a Medium- or High-risk finding is not supported.

As such, wardens are encouraged to select the appropriate risk level carefully during the submission phase.

## Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues

_Note for C4 wardens: Anything included in this `Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues` section is considered a publicly known issue and is ineligible for awards._

The 4naly3er report can be found [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2025-04-kinetiq/blob/main/4naly3er-report.md).

1. Some of the sanity checks and rules around the validator slashing mechanisms are assumptions based upon our current understanding
1. The `generatePerformance` function is a sanity check and is unrelated to rewards or funds, we understand it has complex logic but would encourage auditors not to spend too much time on this function

‚úÖ SCOUTS: Please format the response above üëÜ so its not a wall of text and its readable.

# Additional context

## Main invariants

As a liquid staking protocol, our primary invariant is that 1 kHYPE === 1 HYPE



‚úÖ SCOUTS: Please format the response above üëÜ so its not a wall of text and its readable.

## Attack ideas (where to focus for bugs)
future upgradeability as hyperliquid is known to change things quickly and without notice, recovery from a compromised contract

we also have some off chain components that help maintain protocol
